# Text Summarization Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a **text summarization** pipeline using **Hugging Face's transformer models**. The model is fine-tuned on a text summarization task and integrated into a **FastAPI** application for **real-time prediction**. The project demonstrates an end-to-end process for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, from training the model to serving it via a web API.

### **Key Features**:
- **Text Summarization**: The model generates summaries for long text documents.
- **Hugging Face Transformer Model**: Utilizes the **Pegasus** model from Hugging Face's library for text summarization.
- **FastAPI Integration**: The trained model is served as a REST API for real-time predictions.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Data preprocessing, model training, and API deployment are all part of the project pipeline.

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**

The text summarization model requires a **large dataset** of documents and their corresponding summaries. The preprocessing step involves:
- **Loading the dataset** (such as news articles or any text corpus).
- **Tokenizing** the input text into subword units using the Hugging Face tokenizer.
- **Padding/Truncating** sequences to a fixed length for input to the model.

### 2. **Model Selection and Training**

The core of this project uses the **Pegasus** model, a transformer-based architecture pre-trained on large text corpora. The model is fine-tuned on a summarization task using your preprocessed dataset.

- **Model**: `google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail`
- **Libraries**: Hugging Face's **transformers** and **datasets** libraries.

### 3. **FastAPI Integration**

Once the model is trained and saved, the next step is to **serve the model using FastAPI**. FastAPI is used to create a web API endpoint for summarization requests:
- **Input**: The user sends a text string to the API.
- **Output**: The API returns the model-generated summary.

This allows real-time usage of the text summarization model, enabling users to submit long documents and receive concise summaries.

### 4. **Deployment**

The model and FastAPI server are packaged into a **Docker container** and deployed to a cloud environment:
- **AWS EC2** or **Azure Web App** for hosting the application.
- The Dockerized FastAPI application ensures that the model and the server are portable and scalable.
